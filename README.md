# Overlord - Home-manager for my IOT devices (All Tasmota at the moment)

Configuring my tasmota devices by hand is a pain. We ideally want to:
 1. Watch for new devices to show up under a Esspress Mac-id_rsa_stronger
 1. Based on the range (theory) - chose their Template
 1. Apply liberally, overwriting what's there


### Requires:
 1. ansible-galaxy role install oefenweb.locales

### FIXME:
 1. Move IP Address to Vault or something to put structure on the interwebs
